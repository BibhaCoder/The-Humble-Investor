Please note that always the best investment is investment in our personal well-being, skills development and in our mental and physical health. No investment in the world can match the returns of investing in our well-being and inturn achieving an enormous long life filled with enormous health, wealth and wisdom. Following are 5 basic fundamental concepts to master for our mental and physical health and wellbeing:
1) Mindfulness: Daily practice of mindfulness meditation can help to reduce anxiety and stress and boost our daily cognitive abilities.
2) Activity: Stay active and do at least one hour of daily physical activity(walking, swimming, running, cycling, yoga, playing favorite sports, excercise in gym etc.)
3) Food: We are result of what we eat so chose carefully what to eat. Primarily fresh healthy plants, fruits, nuts, whole grains and vegetables based food in small portions.
4) Sleep: Similar to being active getting enough eight to ten hours of good sleep is extremely important for our mind and body to recharge and work with full capabilities.
5) Gratitude: Daily practice of gratitude can reduce hedonic adaptations of life and keep us focused on living in the moment and enjoying every moment of life.

Investing field is quite complex and challenging and pretending to know everything in the world of investing is trying to fool ourself and achieve mediocre returns and drastically under perform market(VOO/VTI) in long run. There is so much noise, nonsense and distractions in the world of investment that a common investor can easily get distracted and make huge mistakes because of their uncontrolled emotions. Primary purpose of this article is to guide small individual common investors on how to take the field of investment with humility and simplicity to achieve market beating returns in long run to achieve financial independence and become a truly successful humble investor. In modern world where average humans are living longer, its more important to achieve financial independence and investing is one of the most important tools to achieve financial independence. At the end in whatever profession we all are working, our end goal is to achieve financial independence.

Successful investing is an intellectual field of education and analysis. Trying to enter the field of investing without having this basic education is like trying to enter the field of medical surgeory without having adequate education and experience. Default human instinct is propelled by uncontrolled emotions and amygdala fuelled basic survival instincts which often does not work well in the this field considering the amount of information and misinformation is circulated every second of the day. The complexity of this field can be easily understood from the fact that 99% of actively managed(managed by highly educated and trained professionals) US equity funds underperform and fail to beat their respective passive benchmark index over long term. This article I have created after reading numerous books on investing and finally have found that these are 3 most important books on investing which a common humble investor must read before entering the field of investing:

1) Little book on common sense of investing: John C Bogle

2) The intelligent investor: Benjamin Graham

3) Common stocks and uncommon profit: Phil fisher

After reading above 3 book I have found that in modern world the field of stock investing should be dealt with humility and simplicity. A humble investor should look for following 5 key characteristics(tests) in an ETF to achieve long term market beating(VOO/VTI benchmark) returns:

1) Low cost (total expense ration should be <= 0.15 and absolutely no enter/exit loads)

2) Passively managed (should track a proven index which is at least a decade old and benefit from natural selection of survival of fittest)

3) Highly concentrated (should have higher allocation to growing and innovative sectors and avoid over diversification)

4) Innovation (should be focused on holding best available innovative businesses in the country)

5) Growth (should be focused on holding best available growing business in the country)

Instead of doing speculation and trying to invest in risky and speculative securities/assets a humble investor should look for above 5 characteristics in ETFs and invest in them for very very long term. A humble investor’s ETF must have very low total expense ration <= 0.15 with absolutely no enter and exit fees(loads) such that the humble investor makes most of the earned money and not the investment management firm. It should also be passively managed with full-replication approach whenever possible and track a proven solid index which is at least 10 years old and avoid new experimental risky indices which are not proven yet. Please note that the entire gain in the U.S. stock-market since 1926 is attributable to only 4% of the stocks thats means combined 96% listed stocks are losers(only match treasury bill return) in long term in this brutal competitive world. A humble investor should only rely on time tested and proven indices and avoid getting trapped into marketing gimmicks of investment management firms. Passively managed ETFs helps us to easily stick with our chosen investment philosophy and avoids human emotion trigerred mistakes and improve tax efficiency by avoiding frequent portfolio turn overs. Passively managed index replicates nature's law of survival of fittest and underperforming businesses are automaticaly removed from the index. A humble investor should avoid actively managed funds because actively managed funds always lose their luster and underperform their respective passive benchmark index over long run because of high costs, genuinely unskilled professional managers, human emotional mistakes of changing fund managers etc. Short term out performance by an active manager is 100% attributable to luck, infact it requires minimum 22 years of consistent outperformance(compare to their respective passive benchmark index) to know if a professional manager is 90% skilled. Even best of the best active professionals and fund managers fail to beat their passive benchmark consistently over very long time. Active managed funds also eat up a large portion of investors profits because of high management fees and tax inefficiencies because of very frequent portfolio turn overs. A humble investor’s ETF should also be highly concentrated to avoid over diversification and should have higher allocations to growing and innovative sectors. A humble investor's ETF should be focused on holding best available innovative and growing businesses. Innovation and growth are key for long term success of any business so look for ETFs which are made of innovative and growing businesses.

A humble investor does not need 20 to 50 non leveraged ETFs to get proper diversification in a core portfolio. Only 2 (one pair: one focused around growing and another focused around innovative businesses)non leveraged ETFs selected based on above 5 characteristics are good enough for the core portfolio for a humble investor to achieve long term market beating(VOO/VTI) returns. And finally holding period for a humble investor should be forever. A humble investor should completely avoid moving around and frequent tradings. A humble investor should only be focused on periodic buying and this way achieve behavioral alpha which also helps to beat market averages(VOO/VTI) by significant margin in long run. Please note that successful investing does not require very high intelligence. Successful investing requires a cool and stable temprament. A humble investor should focus on achieving excellence at their respective profession and keeping their everyday expenses low such that maximum savings can be invested with the principles of humble investing and let the magic of compounding work for them in long term to achieve financial independence. Basically idea of humble investing is to invest in highly concentrated group of best innovative and growing businesses of your country with lowest possible cost and over long run grow together with your country's growth. The moment common small investors realizes the ground reality of investing world(filled with noise, nonsense and distractions) and stick with above 5 basic principles of humble investing(low cost, passively managed,  highly concentrated, innovative and growing businesses) they beat 99% of active investors and fund managers over long run.

So far after evaluating hundreds of non leveraged ETFs for implementing the core strategy, I have found very few ETFs which consistently pass all the above mentioned 5 tests(low cost, passively managed, highly concentrated, innovation and growth) of humble investing and the ones which I like and appreciate for their extremely low cost, high concentration of growing and innovative businesses and their solid proven passive strategy for more than last 15 years. Please note that there could be more equally good ETFs in the market which may consistently pass all above 5 tests and could be part of a humble investor's core portfolio. Below mentioned ETFs are just examples to demonstrate the strength of humble investing principles and it's consistent market beating performance. Following is their performance in comparison with VOO benchmark for implementing the core strategy:

|  NAV return       | VOO         | VUG      |  MGK     | NDX          |
| ------------------| ----        | ----     | ----     | ----         |
| Net expense ratio | (0.03)      | (0.04)   | (0.07)   | (0.15)       |
| 3 years           | 26.03       | 34.78    | 35.57    | 38.04        |
| 5 years           | 18.43       | 24.78    | 25.66    | 28.37        |
| 10 years          | 16.51       | 19.30    | 19.83    | 22.88        |
| Since inception   |  8.21       | 12.13    | 14.02    | 13.80        |
| Inception year    | (2000)      | (2004)   | (2007)   | (1986)       |
| Category           |(Benchmark) | (Growth) | (Growth) | (Innovation) |

A humble investor should be careful and avoid new market trendy and catchy sector/subsector sepcifc ETFs whose underlying index/market sector is not yet proven(has not survived past 10 years survival test). That means trendy ETFs whose underlying index and market sector is not yet proven/established to be growing and innovating should be avoided. Most of the time very 1st test of low cost(total expense ratio <= 0.15) should be able to filter out majority of new unproven trendy sub-sector ETFs as most of these new trendy ETFs are marketing propagandas and primarily launched to make money from their high fees by looking trendy and attractive to new investors.

A humble investor may also employ core and alpha strategy. Core strategy consists of buying and holding forever two non leveraged ETFs selected based on above 5 principles(low cost, passively managed, highly concentrated,  innovative business and growing businesses). Alpha strategy may consist of a safe and solid 3x leveraged ETF based on a solid major broad stock market index to boost the long term returns with 200 days daily moving average cash leveraged rotation strategy(200-d CLRS) to filter out volatility. As part of 200 days moving average cash rotation strategy only buying and holding a 3x leveraged ETF only if its underlying index closes above its 200 days moving average and rotating to cash whenever its underlying index closes below its 200 days moving average to avoid volatility decay. For young investors who have very little amount of money to invest its more sensible and intelligent approach to use a safe and solid less volatile proven broad stock market index based 3x leveraged ETFs to get more exposure to stocks and boost long-term returns in tax deferred IRA/HSA accounts. Leveraged FTFs total expense ration should be less than 1.0 percent and they should track a solid less volatile proven stock index. Natural safe leverage can also be achieved to boost long term returns by periodically investing large sum of saved money to get greater exposure to the market as part of core strategy. All other types of dangerous leverages like borrowing money from home or at a high interest rates(credit cards) etc. should be avoided at all costs. Modern days leveraged ETFs are best ways to get leverage and more exposure to securities market with lowest possible cost. By using 3x leveraged ETF based on a major broad stock market index risk is dramatically reduced. Do not gamble with individual games in a casino instead own the entire casino and gauranteed make money where as vast majority of individual gamblers will have to lose money at the end. Small common investors should focus on their well-being and enjoying every day life and never worry about the noise and distractions of securities market activities.

As part of alpha strategy a humble investor may employ modern trading platforms stop_loss sell and buy orders to automatically exit and enter the leveraged ETF position based on above mentioned cash rotation strategy without any active involvement and any personal emotional triggers. Please note that a person's uncontrolled emotions are biggest hurdles in the path of successful investing. Standard market risk was always there and will always be even in future. If any person wants to see the most dangerous risk then she/he should sit idle and simply focus on their breathing(mindfulness meditation) and mindfully watch their uncontrolled thoughts(approximately 50 thoughts per minute) and emotions to realize that the actual biggest risk is residing in their mind as form of amygdala fuelled uncontrolled thoughts and emotions. Modern trading platforms have evolved for good reasons and made it very easy to employ a passive hands off automated alpha strategy. As a human being we should remember our evolution from great apes which makes us biologically prone to herd and croud mentality. Following herd or crowd is the biggest mistake investors can do. Smart and intelligent investors should keep themselves detached from the crowd and stay focused on their chosen investment principles through thick and thin.

In today's market leveraged ETF UPRO (3x S&P 500) can be used for implementing the alpha strategy and as per research paper [Leverage for the Long Run](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701) above mentioned alpha strategy has returned an alpha of 17.5% since 1928 in comparison to s&p 500 index and has avoided volatility decay of all past major market corrections. Using modern trading platforms stop_loss sell and buy orders and UPRO ETF this alpha strategy can be easily passively implemented in IRA/HSA tax deferred account. Following is performance of S&P 500  since OCT 1928 to DEC 2020 compare to S&P 500 3x levearge with and without 200 days moving average cash leveraged rotation strategy(200-d CLRS).

We should be very careful in chosing role models in our life. We should chose very carefully, who we want imitate in our life and pick the people whom we want to mimick very carefully. At the end life is much more than just plain earnign money. A successful human life consists of 4 key characteristics:

1) An enormous long life
2) Filled with enormous health
3) Filled with enormous wealth and
4) Filled with enormous wisdom

Cultivating growth mindset is very important for living a successful and meaningful life. Growth mindset has its roots in neuroscience and a concept called brain placiticity which means neurons connections between our brains changes with learning. Individuals with growth mindset believe that their talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. No one is born as a good or bad human being. Every human being has potential to use growth mindset and achieve excellence in their life. Please note that neuroscience has already confirmed that  nurture is more important than nature. Individuals with growth mindset believes that they can achieve anything in their life if they set mind on it. Growth mindset encourages learning process over results and gives more importance to enjoying the journey and the process of putting genuine wholehearted effort irrespective of whatever is end result. People with growth mindsets know that they can handle any situation and thrive in every environment which life throws on their way. Growth mindset people are problem solvers and in addition to improving their and their families life they also improve life's of other countless individuals.

For a successful, meaningful and fulfilling human life we should focus on nurturing and cultivating growth mindset and all 24 human character strengths to be a better human for our spouse, kids, family, friends and our society in every aspect. Every human being is special and unique with respect to their signature character strengths. Character strength has its roots in science of positive psychology which gives more importance to nurturing what is best about human beings across different human cultures and societies. My personal signature character strengths are: judgment(rational and critical thinking), love of learning, bravery, perserverence(resilience and grit), zest, kindness(compassion), social intelligence, leadership, self regulation, humility, gratitude and sprituality.  

24 character strengths to cultivate for being a better human  being for our spouse, kids, family, friends, society  and complete humanity are:

1) Wisdom: Creativity, Curiosity, Judgement(Rational and Critical thinking), Love of learning, Perspective
2) Courage: Bravery, Perserverence, Integrity(Honesty), Zest
3) Humanity: Love, Kindness(Compassion), Social Intelligence(Emotional Intelligence)
4) Justice: Teamwork, Fairness, Leadership
5) Temperence: Self regulation, Prudence, Humility, Forgiveness
6) Transendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, Gratitude, Hope, Humour and Sprituality

To be successful in any professional work environment we needs character strengths like: Integrity, Social Intelligence(Emotional Intelligence), Teamwork, Fairness and Leadership. Similarly to be successful in business and investment world we need character strengths like: Judgement(Rational and Critical thinking), Love of learning, Bravery, Perserverence, Self regulation. To be successful in personal and social relationships we need character strengths like: Love, Compassion, Social Inteligence(Emotional Intelligence), Forgiveness, Humility.

The secret of a successful and fulfilling life is to achieve a healthy balance between various elements, thoughts and philosophies available in the universe. As the earth's balanced distance(not too far and not too close) from the sun ensures flourishing of diverse life and ecosystem on earth, similarly a healthy balance between dark matter and dark energy ensures survival of our very own universe. Every star in our universe shines because of the balance between its massive gravity crushing its core and nuclear fusion in the core trying to blow it up. Similarly for a successful and fulfilling like we need to maintain a healthy balance in our life and avoid extremes of anything.

To be a good human being for our spouse, kids, family, friends and society I found learning and applying these principles in our life from following books very helpful:

1) The Art of Happiness: by Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler
2) The Science of Well-Being: by Laurie Santos(Yale University online course)
3) Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life: by Marshall B. Rosenberg PhD 
4) How to Win Friends & Influence People: by Dale Carnegie
5) Mindset: The New Psychology of Success: by Carol S. Dweck PhD

Please note that in the field of investing high priests(hedge funds, active professional fund money managers, investment management firms etc.) have no edge over common people if common people can employ the above mentioned principles of humble investing with proper discipline. By following above simple principles of humble investing small common investors can easily achieve financial independence by becoming millionaires and billionaires over long time of investment horizon instead of making fund managers and investment management firms rich who are already filthy rich. Please note that the less we pay for investing the more we earn at the end for ourself. Primary goal of investment management industry should be to add value to thier society by making more and more people financially independent but today's majority of active fund management does exactly the opposite by underperforming their respective benchmark index and charging humongous fees for example 1% fee over 40 years could eat up 25% of total investment results. There is so much noise, nonsense and distractions every day on TV, investing business news, internet etc. that can easily mislead small common investors to make huge mistakes and destroy their wealth. The principles of humble investing protects small common investors from outside noise and keep them focused for very long term and inturn achieve financial independence and live an enormous long life filled with enormous health, wealth and wisdom.
