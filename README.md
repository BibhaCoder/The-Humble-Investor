The Humble Investor
===================

Investing field is quite complex and challenging and pretending to know everything in the world of investing is trying to fool yourself and achieve mediocre returns and drastically under perform market(VOO/VTI) in long run. There is so much noise and distractions in the world of investment that a common investor can easily get distracted and make huge mistakes. Primary purpose of this article is to teach individual small investors on how to take the field of investment with humility and simplicity to achieve market beating returns in long run.

This article I have created after reading numerous books on investing and finally have concluded that there are 3 most important books on investing which everyone should must read before entering the field of investing:

1) Little book on common sense of investing: John C Bogle

2) The intelligent investor: Benjamin Graham

3) Common stocks and uncommon profit: Phil fisher

After reading above 3 book I have found that in modern world the field of stock investing should be dealt with humility and simplicity. A humble investor should look for following 5 key characteristics in an ETF to achieve long term market beating(VOO/VTI benchmark) returns:

1) Low cost (expense ration should be <= 0.20)

2) Passively managed (should track an index)

3) Highly concentrated (should have higher allocation to growing and innovative sectors)

4) Innovation (should be focused on holding innovative businesses)

5) Growth (should be focused on holding growing business)

Instead of doing speculation and trying to invest in risky and speculative securities/assets a humble investor should look for above 5 characteristics in ETFs and invest in them for long term. A humble investor’s ETF must have expense ration <= 0.20. It should also be passively managed to avoid human emotion trigerred mistakes and improve tax efficiency by avoiding frequent turn overs. A humble investor’s ETF should also be highly concentrated to avoid over diversification and should have higher allocations to growing and innovative sectors. A humble investor's ETF should be focused on holding innovative and growing businesses. Innovation and growth are key for long term success of any business so look for ETFs which are made of innovative and growing businesses.

A humble investor does not need 20 to 50 ETFs to get proper diversification. Only 2 ETFs focused on above 5 characteristics are good enough for a humble investor to achieve long term market beating(VOO/VTI) returns. And finally holding period for a humble investor should be forever :)

I was able to achieve this investing insight only because I was sitting on the shoulders of following 3  giants of investing world: 

1) John C Bogle

2) Warren buffet and Charlie Munger

3) Phil Fisher
